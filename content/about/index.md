Hi there 👋 

My name is **Chenmeinian Guo 「郭陈美年」**. I'm currently a graduate student at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) studying Computer Science. I was born and raised in Shanghai, a bustling city that shaped my early years. After earning my Bachelor’s degree in Computer and Information Science from [the Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu) — a place far quieter than my hometown — I moved to NYC to pursue my graduate studies.

My primary interests lie in the fields of software development and deep learning (especially Large Language Model). Last summer, I am excited to intern at the headquarters of [Bilibili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili), a top-tier video sharing platform in China. Here, I am engaging with dynamic teams to enhance media technologies that millions enjoy.

Beyond coding and algorithms, I enjoy playing guitar. Music, especially exploring different genres and blending them (e.g. fusion), fascinates me just as much as any engineering puzzle. Although I’m currently at a beginer-intermediate level, my goal is to reach an advanced stage where I can play by ear and jam with friends and fellow music enthusiasts. I also have a keen interest in finance, always trying to understand more about the economic forces shaping our world. On the travel front, I recently had the opportunity to attend my first live metal concert last summer in Milano, Italy.
