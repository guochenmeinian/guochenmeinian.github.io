Hi there 👋 

My name is **Chenmeinian Guo 「郭陈美年」**, a Computer Science graduate student at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/). Originally from Shanghai, I studied at [the Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu) before moving to New York. These days, I spend most of my time working on large language models — and occasionally, on my guitar skills.

My primary interests lie in the fields of software development and LLM (Large Language Model). At NYU Courant, I took courses like Efficient AI Computing, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Big Data Application, DevOps, etc. Through my courses and internships — from backend engineering to full-stack agent development to model training — I’ve seen how each part of the AI stack connects, from infra level to applications level. As a new grad, I’m excited to keep learning and find my place in this evolving field.

Beyond coding and algorithms, I enjoy playing guitar. Music, especially exploring different genres and blending them (e.g. fusion), fascinates me just as much as any engineering puzzle. Although I’m currently at a beginer-intermediate level, my goal is to reach an advanced stage where I can play by ear and jam with friends and fellow music enthusiasts. I'm also interested in learning finance and how to invest. On the travel front, I attended my first live metal concert last summer in Milano, Italy.
