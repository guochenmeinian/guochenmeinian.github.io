Hi there 👋 

Here's a short summary/selection of my past experiences.

{{ double_image(path1="about/tezign_window.png", path2="about/meituan_building.jpeg", height=1000, width=650, op="fit_height") }}

⬆ Tezign & Meituan


I started out with software engineering — during my time at [Bilibili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili) as a software engineer intern, I worked on gRPC integration, audio–video decoding, and network protocols, which gave me hands-on experience with low-level systems and playback engineering. 

Later, at [Tezign](https://en.tezign.com/), I gained hands-on experience building AI agents and working in fast-paced startup environments.
I became familiar with a modern TypeScript stack — including React, Node.js, Prisma (PostgreSQL), and Redis — and learned how to iterate quickly in production while developing a stronger sense for both functionality and product design.


Most recently, at [Meituan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meituan), I’ve been working on data preparation, model evaluation, and pre-training support for multimodal large models as part of the [LongCat-Flash-Omni](https://huggingface.co/meituan-longcat/LongCat-Flash-Omni) project — involving data filtering, deduplication, importance sampling, as well as data annealing and pre-training experiments.
